MineCraft HockeyMod
===================

Mod to Minecraft that adds Hockey to the game.

Current version: 0.1
--

This mod is in early development phase, so this repository is only for contributing, not playing the mod.
You will need Minecraft Coder Pack and ModLoader in order to get this work.

In order to make this run, you need to install ModLoader mod to your minecraft, and decompile sources with MCP.
Then simply add this repository's `src` folder to Java Build Path.
You also need to copy the `images` folder into `mcp\jars\bin\minecraft.jar` archive, and rename to `hockeymod` folder.

**Current progress:** Adding basic items and recipes

**Next step:** Figure out basic skating physics and puck handling

More detailed info about plans can be found and discussed in the [issues](https://github.com/teo-sk/mc-hockeymod/issues).

First builds for public should be done after basic physics is added, and that will be the first beta.
